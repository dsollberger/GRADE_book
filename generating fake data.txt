Hi all!  Does anyone have a recommendation for an R package or process where I can create fake data where ...?
I can choose which numerical variables are highly correlated with the response variable
also have categorical variables (some binary, some with several factors)
I'm trying to write tutorials for myself to better understand PCA, CFA, mixed-models, etc.

I keep meaning to try this out. I don't know if it will work for what you want, but I think your use case is an example of what it's for: https://github.com/ThinkR-open/fakir

{wakefield} is another option. It allows you to specify correlations. (edited)
